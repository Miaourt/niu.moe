# Wtf is that

niu.moe has been a cozy place on the fediverse from April 2017 to the last day of 2020.

I wanted to put something instead of a blank page, in memory of the 6k~ users and the fun we had \o/

It have been made with https://animejs.com/ and a bunch of dirty hacks, that not really pretty code.
